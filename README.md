 # Image Captioning with Encoder-Decoder Framework Image captioning aims to convert a given input image into a natural language description. This project employs the encoder-decoder framework, with a CNN (ResNet-152) as the encoder and an LSTM network as the decoder.The image encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this tutorial, we used [resnet-152](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model pretrained on the [ILSVRC-2012-CLS](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/) image classification dataset. The decoder is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.
